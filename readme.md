Q: What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
A: getElementById selects a single element based on its unique ID and is very fast, but the ID must be unique. getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a specific class and returns a live HTMLCollection that updates if the DOM changes. querySelector allows us to select the first element matching a CSS selector, while querySelectorAll selects all matching elements and returns a static NodeList. These methods let us choose elements in different ways depending on whether you need one, many, or CSS-style flexibility.

Q: How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM ?
A: First, I create a new element in memory using createElement. Next, I set its content, attributes, or classes as needed. Finally, I attach it to a parent element in the DOM using methods like appendChild, prepend, or insertBefore. This allows me to dynamically add content to the page without touching the HTML manually. I can think of it as crafting a piece and placing it exactly where it’s needed.

Q: What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
A: Event bubbling is when an event triggered on a child element automatically propagates upward to its parent elements in the DOM. This means that if we click a button inside a card, the click event first affects the button, then the card, and then higher-level elements. It’s the default behavior for most events and is useful when we want multiple levels to respond. However, it can sometimes trigger unwanted behavior if not handled carefully. We can think of it like ripples spreading outward in a pond.

Q: What is Event Delegation and why is it useful?
A: Event delegation is a technique where we attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple child elements. The parent listens for events from any of its children, including elements added dynamically later. This reduces memory usage and simplifies code, especially when dealing with many elements. It also ensures that new elements added to the page automatically respond to events. Essentially, it’s like having one supervisor watch over a team instead of one supervisor per worker.

Q: What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()?
A: preventDefault() stops the browser’s default behavior, such as following a link or submitting a form, without affecting event flow. stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing parent elements from reacting to it. They can be used together when we want to control both what the browser does and how events travel through the DOM. Knowing when to use each gives us precise control over event handling in your page.
